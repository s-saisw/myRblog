Materials here are adapted from the slides I used while TA'ing for Practice Session for Econometrics for Public Policy class (S2020) at the Graduate School of Public Policy, UTokyo. The class roughly follows Wooldridge's *Introductory Economics - A Modern Approach* and Angrist and Pischke's *Mastering 'Metrics: The Path from Cause to Effect*.

Most of data sets used here are taken from ```wooldridge``` package.

This website is still an ongoing project. Comments are welcomed.
